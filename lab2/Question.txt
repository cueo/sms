A small grocery store has M checkout counters. Customers arrive at the checkout counter at random from 1 to 8 minutes apart with equal probability. The service times vary from 1 to 6 minutes with the probabilites as shown in the table. The problem is to analyze the system by simulating the arrival and service of N customers.

Service Time Distribution:

Time	Prob
1			0.10
2			0.20
3			0.30
4			0.25
5			0.10
6			0.05

i)	Simulate for M = 1
ii)	Simulate for M = 2

Print the output in a formatted way in the terminal OR push the results into a CSV file.
